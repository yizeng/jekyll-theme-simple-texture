On December 23rd, Be Bold Street Ministries visited Union Gospel
Mission to hand out Christmas presents to everyone at the big Christmas feast.

We were there with Dutch Brothers, who provided coffee and cocoa.  Everyone
was able to walk away with some winter necessities.

Be Bold Street Ministry delivered hand warmers, gloves, and candy.  
It was a blessing to celebrate the holidays with our homeless families.
